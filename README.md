## General Usage Notes
This application is an interactive matching game. The user will click to find all 8 matches. Once the game is complete, the user will be rated by the number of move counts via a star rating of 1-3. The game also contains a timer, so the user can know how it took to complete the game in set number of moves. 



## Instructions

Originally, the starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. The project has now been updated from a static project to an interactive one. The HTML and CSS files have been slightly modified, with the addition of font awesome and JQuery, but primarily the JavaScript file have been modified to include interactive functions like card flips, card matches, a set timer, an active reset button, and a star rating system.

To add to the game, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
